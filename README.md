# drakeowen.io
drakeowen.io is my personal site built to showcase my skills in web development.

Previously this site was built as a static web page but now is a full MERN stack application. It is not yet live on my site but I plan to host it on my own web server when I finish the first production build.

You'll find that this web app was built and structured as a blog. However, I want it to be flexible enough to evolve and grow with my skills.
