# drakeowen.io
drakeowen.io is my personal site built to showcase my skills in web development.

In the repo you'll find a previous version of the site that was built using static HTML. That version was then replaced with a MERN stack application.

You'll find that this web app was built and structured as a blog. However, I want it to be flexible enough to evolve and grow with my skills.
